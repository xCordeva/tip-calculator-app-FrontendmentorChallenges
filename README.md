## Overview

This project showcases my ability to build a responsive and interactive web application that helps users calculate tips and total costs based on their bill amount, selected tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the bill.


### The challenge

The primary challenge of the Tip Calculator App is to create a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface that meets the following requirements:

- Responsive Layout: The app should adapt smoothly to different device screen  sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Interactive Elements: Interactive elements such as buttons and input fields should display hover states to enhance user feedback and engagement.
- Tip Calculation: The app should accurately calculate the tip amount and the total bill per person based on the bill amount, selected tip percentage, and the number of people.
